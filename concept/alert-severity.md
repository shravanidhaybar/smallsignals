# Alert Severity (Beginner Notes)

Alert severity indicates how serious a security alert is
and how urgently it needs attention.

## Common severity levels
- Low: Informational or low-risk activity
- Medium: Suspicious behavior that needs review
- High: Likely security threat requiring action
- Critical: Confirmed incident with high impact

## How severity is decided
- Type of activity detected
- Confidence of detection
- Impact on system or data
- Context from investigation
