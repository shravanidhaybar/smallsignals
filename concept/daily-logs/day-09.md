## Day 09 – Alert Severity and Escalation

What I learned today:
- Alerts are classified based on severity
- Not all alerts require the same response

Example I understood:
- A confirmed brute-force attempt
should be escalated to a higher level

Why this matters:
Severity classification helps SOC teams
manage time and resources effectively.

What confused me:
- How automated systems assign severity

Next step:
Learn basic incident response actions.
