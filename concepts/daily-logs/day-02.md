## Day 02 – Introduction to Logs and Detection Thinking

What I focused on today:
- Understanding what logs are
- Why SOC analysts rely on logs for detection

Key learning:
- Logs are raw data; detections come from patterns in logs

Example scenario I understood:
- 10 failed login attempts from the same IP could indicate brute force

What confused me:
- Which logs are most important in real SOC environments

What I will do tomorrow:
- Learn authentication logs in detail
