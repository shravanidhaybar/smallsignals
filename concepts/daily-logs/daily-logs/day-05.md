## Day 05 – Creating My First Detection Idea

What I worked on today:
- Learned what a detection rule is
- Created a basic detection idea using login logs

Detection idea I documented:
- Multiple failed logins from the same IP
within a short time window

Why today was important:
This helped me understand how SOC analysts
convert patterns into alerts.

What confused me:
- How many failed attempts are considered suspicious

Next step:
Learn about false positives and alert tuning.
