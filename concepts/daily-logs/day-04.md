## Day 04 – Login Patterns and Detection Logic

What I learned today:
- Difference between normal and suspicious login behavior
- How patterns are more important than single log events

Example pattern I understood:
- Many failed logins followed by one success can be suspicious

Why this is important:
SOC analysts use login patterns to detect brute-force
and unauthorized access attempts.

What confused me:
- How time thresholds are decided in real SOC environments

Next step:
Learn how authentication patterns are used to create alerts.
