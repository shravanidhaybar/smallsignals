# Authentication Logs (Beginner Notes)

Authentication logs record login-related activities on a system.

## What they usually contain:
- Username
- Login success or failure
- Time of attempt
- Source IP address

## Why authentication logs are important:
They help detect unauthorized access and brute-force attempts.

## Example suspicious behavior:
- Multiple failed logins from one IP
- Login attempts at unusual times
- Successful login after many failures

## My understanding:
Authentication logs help SOC analysts identify account compromise.

## What I need to learn more:
How authentication logs differ across systems (Linux, Windows).
