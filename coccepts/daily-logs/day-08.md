## Day 08 – Understanding Alert Investigation

What I learned today:
- Alerts must be investigated before action is taken
- Analysts rely on context, not just alerts

Example investigation idea:
- Review related authentication logs
- Check timing and repetition of events

Why this matters:
Investigation prevents unnecessary escalation
and helps focus on real security incidents.

What confused me:
- How much evidence is enough to confirm an incident

Next step:
Learn how alerts are classified by severity.
