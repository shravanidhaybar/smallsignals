# Day 10 – Foundations & Learning Log

## What I focused on today
- Understanding how GitHub repositories are structured
- Learning how meaningful commits reflect real progress
- Practicing proper documentation using README and notes

## Key concepts learned
- A repository link should be the main GitHub URL (not file paths)
- README.md acts as the first impression of a project
- Small, consistent changes are better than many fake commits

## Why this matters in real engineering
- Clean documentation helps teams understand projects quickly
- Consistent commits
